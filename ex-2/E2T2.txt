Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

Vulnerabilities:
1. Amazon EC2 instance metadata version is IMDSv1
2. Amazon EC2 instance have a public IP association. 
3. EBS volumes are not encrypted.
4. Load Balancer is using HTTP.
5. S3 buckets is not secured.
6. Security Group(for web server) is too opened.

Solution:
1. EC2 instance should be in IMDSv2
2. EC2 instance should not be associated with a public IP.
3. EBS volumes should be encrypted with KMS key.
4. Load Balancer should be in HTTPS protocol.
5. S3 buckets should be encrypted by KMS key.
6. Security Group should be set for the accepted IP, not for all.
